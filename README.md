# HomeWork 1 - Giulio Lecci
Made for Web Programming course at @Unict. <br>
For this task I created an interactive website resembling a social network where you can create/delete posts and add other users to your favorites.<br>
The social evolves as long as you create contents, updating your pro-pic and suggesting new music (via Spotify API) in your home page.<br>
There are also some extra features such as encrypted passwords, show-password button, and a primordial mobile mode.
